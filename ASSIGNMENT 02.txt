1.  Write a program to print the vehicle details.

class Vehicle

Has properties as name, model, price.

Has parameterized constructor

Has method as void getDetails() to print the details of the vehicle

class Main

Has PSVM - create two vehicle objects and call the method

2.  Write a program to calculate the bank details.

class Bank

Has property balance.

Has constructor with balance of type double as parameter

Has method as public void withdraw(int x) to withdraw amount x from balance

Has method as public void deposit(int x) to deposit amount x to balance

Has method as public double getBalance() to return the balance

class Main

Has PSVM - create a bank object. Get the amount to be deposited and call the method. Then the amount to be deposited and call the method. Print the balance after these two operations. If you want you can simulate a virtual ATM. Use a infinite loop. The method to exit is System.exit(0);

3.   Write a program to print grades of two student objects

class Student

Has properties as name, studentId

Has parameterized constructor

Has method as void getDetails() to print the details of the Student

Has method Student getGrades(int [] marks ) to calculate sum, average and grade as A or B or C

class Main

Has PSVM - Get User input to get student name, id and marks (to populate the array).

Now create 2 student objects and populate with the values

Call both the methods to print student details and grade
